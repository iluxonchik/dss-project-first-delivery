# Average Lift Graph Generator

This script is just a fork of `../pygrfs`, so you might want to look up that
one instead. This one might be useful however, if you want to look up on how
you can make quick changes to it. Please note, some of the parts in this
version are hardcoded, since the only purpose of this script was to generate
a few graphs and choose the best bin size for the apriori algoirthm.
